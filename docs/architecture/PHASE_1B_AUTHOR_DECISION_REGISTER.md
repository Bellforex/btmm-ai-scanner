# Phase 1B Author Decision Register

**Document status:** This document is a **governance record of author decisions**, not a new engineering proposal. Every decision recorded below was made by the author, in chat, across Decision Groups 1 through 8, following the Phase 1A architecture planning package. **Recording a decision here does not implement it, install any technology, create any file, or authorize production use.** No repository scaffold, application code, executable schema, dependency file, configuration file, manifest file, test file, fixture file, CI workflow, database, migration, container, credential file, or provider adapter is created by this document.

---

## 1. Purpose

Record, in one canonical place, every author-approved Phase 1B architecture decision made across Decision Groups 1–8, and reconcile those decisions against the 17-item Technology-Stack Decision Register and the 20-item Architecture Decision Gate list from `PHASE_1A_SOFTWARE_FOUNDATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`, so that the author-approval status of every item is unambiguous before any scaffold file is created.

## 2. Phase 1A Baseline Dependency

This register depends on, and does not restate or re-derive, the following prior approvals:

- **Phase 0G sign-off commit:** `23f43676abf6e032a5e96c4077d230cc2283f9b6` ("Approve Phase 0G controlled baseline") — Knowledge Gate **OPEN FOR CONTROLLED FOUNDATION WORK** only; all Phase 0G restrictions remain binding.
- **Phase 1A architecture-planning commit:** `a142da371c766bbc3489d7d9ae26e6421527c6c9` ("Document Phase 1A software foundation architecture") — the 16-layer architecture, 18-contract data model, provenance/validation/audit plan, deterministic testing plan, 17-item Technology-Stack Decision Register, and 20-item Architecture Decision Gate table, all as corrected in that commit.

Nothing in this register alters any Phase 0G trading rule, POI specification, lifecycle standard, or BTMM rule. Nothing in this register alters the Phase 1A layer structure, dependency direction, or evidence-label taxonomy — it only resolves specific technology and policy decisions that Phase 1A left open for author review.

## 3. Governance and Status Vocabulary

Every decision below carries **four independent status axes**. Approving a decision on one axis never silently erases or overwrites another axis — in particular, **approving a decision does not erase its engineering origin.**

| Axis | Meaning | Values used in this document |
|---|---|---|
| **Recommendation origin** | How confidently Phase 1A engineering work proposed this answer, before author approval. | `ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED` (a single, confidently-proposed answer), `ENGINEERING-PROVISIONAL` (a proposed answer with an acknowledged, currently-unresolved sub-question), `DEFERRED` (the proposed answer was explicitly "do not build this yet") |
| **Current author-decision status** | Whether the author has actually decided this item. | `AUTHOR-APPROVED` (every item in this document) |
| **Implementation status** | Whether the decision has been turned into working software. | `NOT YET IMPLEMENTED` (every item in this document — no scaffold exists) |
| **Production status** | Whether the decision, even once implemented, could be used for live/production purposes. | `NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED` (every item in this document — no production approval has ever been given at any phase) |

**Binding rule:** `AUTHOR-APPROVED` + `NOT YET IMPLEMENTED` + `NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED` is the status of every decision in this register. None of the three statements substitutes for either of the others.

## 4. Decision Group 1 — Core Python Toolchain

| Decision | Approved value | Recommendation origin | Author-decision status | Implementation status | Production status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Primary language and initial runtime | Python 3.12 | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Runtime-version policy | Pin one exact Python 3.12 patch version during the scaffold task; change only through reviewed updates | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Package manager | uv | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Central project manifest | `pyproject.toml` | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED (newly made explicit as its own decision in this group; previously implicit under the package-manager item) | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED — **the file itself is not created by this document** | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Reproducibility lockfile | `uv.lock`, must be committed once created | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED — **the file itself is not created by this document** | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Schema and validation | Pydantic v2 | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Testing | pytest | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Static typing | mypy | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Formatting | Ruff formatter | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Linting | Ruff linter | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |

No `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, or any Python file is created by this document.

## 5. Decision Group 2 — Storage Foundation

| Decision | Approved value | Recommendation origin | Author-decision status | Implementation status | Production status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Storage formats | Parquet for bulk tabular historical records; JSONL for append-only event and audit streams | ENGINEERING-PROVISIONAL | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Initial database strategy | No database during the initial scaffold; file-based contracts first | DEFERRED (recommended answer was, and remains, "do not build yet") | AUTHOR-APPROVED (the *deferral itself* is now an author-approved position, not merely an engineering suggestion) | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Raw-data storage strategy | Append-only, immutable, partitioned, provider-traceable | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Migration strategy | No database migration system until a database is separately approved | DEFERRED | AUTHOR-APPROVED (the deferral itself) | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |

**Raw data must preserve** (binding requirement on the raw-data storage strategy decision above): original provider values; provider identity; feed identity; provider symbol; provider timeframe; retrieval metadata; ingestion metadata; quarantine and validation traceability; separation from normalized records.

**Still deferred within this group** (not resolved by this document): exact raw-payload physical encoding; retention periods; partition naming; database selection (once a database is eventually approved). See Part 14 below.

## 6. Decision Group 3 — Time, Symbols and Configuration

| Decision | Approved value | Recommendation origin | Author-decision status | Implementation status | Production status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Canonical normalized time zone | UTC | ENGINEERING-PROVISIONAL (Phase 1A labeled canonical-UTC-with-source-preservation `ENGINEERING-PROVISIONAL`) | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Canonical internal symbols | XAUUSD, EURUSD, GBPUSD, represented via separate `internal_symbol` / `provider` / `provider_symbol` / `display_symbol` / `symbol_mapping_version` fields | Underlying symbol list: `AUTHOR-APPROVED` pre-existing (Phase 0G, `docs/PROJECT_SCOPE.md`); the field-separation scheme itself: ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Canonical timeframe enum | M1, M5, M15, H1, H3, H4, D1, W1 — uppercase internal enum values | Underlying timeframe list: `AUTHOR-APPROVED` pre-existing (Phase 0G); the enum/representation mechanism itself: ENGINEERING-PROVISIONAL | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Configuration-file format | YAML for human-managed configuration; versioned machine-readable manifest for configuration lineage | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Secrets-management strategy | Environment variables as runtime source; git-ignored local `.env` for development convenience only | ENGINEERING-PROVISIONAL | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |

**Time-zone requirements:** preserve original provider timestamp; preserve source time-zone metadata; never interpret an unknown time zone silently; keep conversions provenance-traceable.

**Symbol/timeframe rules:** provider mappings must be explicit and versioned; preserve provider-native timeframe representations; no silent resampling; no inference when provider metadata conflicts.

**Configuration precedence (author-approved order):** (1) versioned project defaults; (2) versioned environment-specific configuration; (3) runtime environment variables.

**Secrets rules:** no hard-coded secrets; no secrets in YAML or manifests; no secrets in logs, validation reports, or audit events; no silent fallback credentials.

**Still unresolved within this group** (explicitly not resolved by this document): exact candle-close timestamp convention; DST handling; trading-day boundary; week-start convention; month-boundary handling; provider-session handling; Phase 0G period-rollover questions (`P0G-B013A`). See Part 14 below.

## 7. Decision Group 4 — Identity, Versioning and Audit

| Decision | Approved value | Recommendation origin | Author-decision status | Implementation status | Production status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Record identity | UUIDv7 | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED (newly proposed and approved by this decision group; Phase 1A had left the exact identity mechanism to Decision Gate #14) | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Content fingerprint | SHA-256, kept as `content_fingerprint`, separate from record identity | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Versioning scheme | MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Lineage field set | `source_record_id`, `provenance_id`, `schema_version`, `rule_version`, `processing_version`, `created_at`, `supersedes_id` (where applicable), `derived_from_id` (where applicable), `replay_run_id` (where applicable) | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Audit storage/identity | Storage = JSONL; policy = append-only; audit identity = UUIDv7; corrections use new linked events | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |

**UUIDv7 applies to future:** candles, measurements, swings, POIs, interaction events, lifecycle events, BTMM setups, annotations, provenance records, replay runs, audit events, rule-version manifests, schema-version manifests.

**Identity rules:** immutable; never silently reused; new POI formation receives a new `poi_id`; a cancelled BTMM setup is never reactivated under its former ID; reprocessing creates a new record identity; historical identity is never reassigned.

**Fingerprint rules:** `content_fingerprint` remains separate from record identity; a fingerprint may support duplicate detection, integrity, and idempotency; exact canonical contract field sets covered by the fingerprint remain deferred (see Part 14).

**Versioning meaning:** MAJOR = incompatible interpretation or contract change; MINOR = backward-compatible approved expansion; PATCH = clarification that does not alter intended behavior.

**Versioning rules:** published versions are immutable; historical records retain their original versions; reprocessing creates new outputs; historical parents are not overwritten; corrections and supersession are append-only.

**Audit rules:** audit events describe what happened; audit events do not alter domain truth. Audit records must exclude: passwords; tokens; API keys; `.env` contents; unredacted credentials; private-book text; unnecessary personal information.

## 8. Decision Group 5 — CI, Logging and Reproducibility

| Decision | Approved value | Recommendation origin | Author-decision status | Implementation status | Production status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Operational logging | Python standard `logging`, structured JSON output; kept separate from authoritative audit events | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| CI platform | GitHub Actions | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Initial CI checks | Ruff format check; Ruff lint; mypy; pytest | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Manifest / lockfile discipline | Manifest = `pyproject.toml`; lockfile = `uv.lock`, must be committed once created | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED (cross-references Group 1) | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Containerization strategy | DEFERRED — no containerization during the initial scaffold | DEFERRED | AUTHOR-APPROVED (the deferral itself) | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |

**CI restrictions:** offline-safe by default; no broker credentials; no FXCM credentials; no TradingView credentials; no private-book access; no live accounts; no deployment; no signals; no order execution; CI must not modify files silently.

**Lockfile/manifest rules:** dependency changes require review; lockfile regeneration is reviewed; no silently floating dependency resolution; secrets prohibited from `pyproject.toml`.

**During the initial scaffold:** no `Dockerfile`; no `docker-compose.yml`; no container-specific deployment assumptions.

**Explicit non-implication:** passing CI does not imply profitability, market-data validity, model approval, signal safety, execution authorization, or production readiness.

## 9. Decision Group 6 — Candle Data-Quality Policies

| Decision | Approved value | Recommendation origin | Author-decision status | Implementation status | Production status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Candle-completeness policy | `candle_completeness_status = CONFIRMED_COMPLETE \| INCOMPLETE \| UNKNOWN`; only `CONFIRMED_COMPLETE` candles may become analytically eligible | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED (resolves Gate #10, previously `REQUIRES MORE RESEARCH`) | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Duplicate-candle policy | `duplicate_classification = EXACT_DUPLICATE \| CONFLICTING_DUPLICATE \| NOT_DUPLICATE`; candidate key based on provider + provider_symbol + provider_timeframe + candle_open_time | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED (resolves Gate #11, previously `REQUIRES MORE RESEARCH`) | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Missing-candle policy | No synthetic candle creation; `gap_status = POTENTIAL_GAP \| CONFIRMED_MISSING \| EXPECTED_NON_TRADING_INTERVAL \| RESOLVED` | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED (resolves Gate #12, previously `REQUIRES MORE RESEARCH`) | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |

**Completeness rules:** wall-clock time alone does not prove completion; a later completed observation is a new immutable record; completeness is data quality, not trading validity.

**Duplicate rules:** the exact final candidate-key field set remains deferred to schema design (see Part 14). Exact duplicates — preserve every raw envelope; do not create multiple equivalent normalized candles; record duplicate occurrence in validation and audit; do not overwrite the first record. Conflicting duplicates — `QUARANTINED`; preserve every raw record; do not choose a winner silently; do not normalize automatically; do not create measurements; require explicit reviewed resolution.

**Missing-candle rules:** no forward fill; no back fill; no OHLC interpolation; no previous-close copying; no invented zero-volume candles; no silent time compression. A gap becomes `CONFIRMED_MISSING` only under an approved provider/session policy; `POTENTIAL_GAP` and `CONFIRMED_MISSING` make contiguous windows data-ineligible; non-contiguous calculation is allowed only where an approved rule explicitly permits it; gap status affects data eligibility only — it does not automatically invalidate a POI or BTMM setup.

**Clarification (binding on this whole group):** these three policies are resolved at the **policy-decision level**. The provider-specific completion-evidence mechanism, the exact canonical candle-key field set, and any concrete detection implementation remain deferred (see Part 14). **A resolved policy decision does not mean its software exists.**

## 10. Decision Group 7 — Ingestion-Adapter Boundary

| Decision | Approved value | Recommendation origin | Author-decision status | Implementation status | Production status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ingestion architecture | Provider-neutral ports-and-adapters boundary; core interface = `MarketDataSourcePort` | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED (resolves Gate #13, previously `REQUIRES MORE RESEARCH`) | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Initial scaffold position | `INTERFACE_ONLY` | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Early retrieval mode | `OFFLINE_FILE` only | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |

**Permitted during the scaffold:** provider-neutral request contracts; provider-neutral result contracts; adapter metadata requirements; validation hooks; provenance hooks; deterministic offline test doubles where necessary.

**Not approved (by this or any prior document):** live FXCM adapter; TradingView adapter; TradingView scraping; broker authentication; polling; streaming; automated download; network connector.

**Future, not yet authorized:** `HISTORICAL_BATCH`; `POLLING`; `STREAMING` retrieval modes.

**Approved processing sequence:**

```
Retrieval request
  → provider adapter
    → immutable source envelope
      → raw-payload preservation
        → envelope and contract validation
          → parsed raw-candle candidates
            → completeness, duplicate and gap validation
              → normalization eligibility decision
                → normalization boundary
```

**Adapter rules:** raw payload is preserved before normalization; parsing does not authorize normalization; explicit validation eligibility is required; the adapter preserves the original provider symbol; canonical mapping is explicit and versioned; the adapter may not invent aliases; the adapter may not decide POI, market direction, or BTMM validity; the adapter may not resample or fill gaps; the adapter may not choose conflicting duplicates; the adapter may not create measurements, signals, or trades; the adapter may not modify existing raw records.

**Ingestion result version references:** `adapter_version`, `configuration_version`, `schema_version`, `processing_version`, `symbol_mapping_version`, `validation_policy_version`.

**Failure classes (kept distinct):** `transport_failure`, `parsing_failure`, `validation_failure`. No silent repair, discard, infinite retry, or credential leakage.

**Canonical reference (unchanged from Phase 1A):** FXCM data displayed through TradingView remains the canonical visual/feed reference. This does **not** approve: TradingView API access; scraping; FXCM connectivity; licensing; or any specific retrieval mechanism.

## 11. Decision Group 8 — Rule and Schema Version Manifests

| Decision | Approved value | Recommendation origin | Author-decision status | Implementation status | Production status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Machine-readable manifest format | Canonical UTF-8 JSON | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED (resolves Gate #15) | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Schema versioning strategy | Compatibility classes `BACKWARD_COMPATIBLE` \| `BREAKING` \| `DOCUMENTATION_ONLY`, mapped to MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED (resolves Gate #16) | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Schema source of truth | Pydantic v2 models | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Generated JSON Schema role | Machine-readable export only; must not become independently edited truth | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |
| Manifest identity | `rule_version_id` = UUIDv7; `schema_version_id` = UUIDv7; `content_fingerprint` = SHA-256 | ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |

Human-managed configuration remains YAML (unchanged, Group 3).

**Manifest properties:** immutable; versioned; git-reviewable; deterministically serializable; traceable to source commit; SHA-256 fingerprinted; superseded by newer manifests, never silently edited.

**Rule-version manifest proposed fields:** `manifest_type`, `rule_version_id`, `rule_family`, `version`, `status`, `effective_at_utc`, `source_document_paths`, `source_commit`, `author_approval_reference`, `evidence_labels`, `measurement_standard_versions`, `poi_specification_versions`, `lifecycle_standard_versions`, `dependencies`, `supersedes_version`, `content_fingerprint`, `created_at_utc`.

**Rule-manifest rules:** the manifest records approved knowledge; the manifest does not create or approve a trading rule; source documents must already be governed; no private-book text; historical outputs retain the exact manifest used; a referenced rule change requires a new manifest version.

**Schema-version manifest proposed fields:** `manifest_type`, `schema_version_id`, `schema_family`, `version`, `compatibility_class`, `source_model_paths`, `generated_schema_references`, `source_commit`, `processing_version`, `dependencies`, `supersedes_version`, `content_fingerprint`, `created_at_utc`.

**Breaking-change examples:** removing required fields; renaming fields without compatibility handling; changing field meaning; incompatible type changes; identity-semantics changes; timestamp-semantics changes; enum-meaning changes; making an optional field required.

**Version-bump mapping:** breaking change → new MAJOR version; backward-compatible expansion → normally new MINOR version; documentation-only clarification → PATCH only where validation, interpretation, and behavior do not change. **Adding enum values is not automatically safe.**

**Historical schema policy:** historical `schema_version` remains immutable; historical records are not silently rewritten; reprocessing creates new records or replay outputs; future migrations must be explicit, versioned, and audited.

**Fingerprint scope:** covers canonical serialized manifest content, excluding the fingerprint field itself. **Exact canonical JSON serialization procedure remains deferred to implementation** (see Part 14).

**Approved future scaffold destinations:** `manifests/rules/`, `manifests/schemas/`. **No files are created in those directories by this documentation task.**

| 17 | Secrets-management strategy | Environment variables as runtime source; git-ignored local `.env` permitted only for local development convenience | ENGINEERING-PROVISIONAL | AUTHOR-APPROVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED |

**Totals: 17 decisions, 17 `AUTHOR-APPROVED`, 17 `NOT YET IMPLEMENTED`, 17 `NOT PRODUCTION-APPROVED`.** Recommendation origins are preserved exactly as they were in `PHASE_1A_SOFTWARE_FOUNDATION_ARCHITECTURE.md` Part 7: 12 `ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED`, 2 `ENGINEERING-PROVISIONAL` (items 9, 17), 3 `DEFERRED` (items 10, 14, 16). No item's engineering origin was erased or upgraded to `AUTHOR-APPROVED` in place of its origin — the two axes are recorded side by side. **No `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock` file is created by this document.**

## 13. Final 20-Gate Resolution Matrix

| # | Gate name | Original readiness classification | Approving decision group | Current decision status | Implementation status | Remaining sub-decisions | Scaffold blocking status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Primary language and runtime | READY FOR AUTHOR DECISION | Group 1 | AUTHOR-DECISION RESOLVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | Exact Python 3.12 patch version | Not blocking further decision review; blocks scaffold pending separate scaffold-entry instruction |

| 20 | CI policy | READY FOR AUTHOR DECISION | Group 5 | AUTHOR-DECISION RESOLVED | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | Branch-protection policy; mandatory pull-request policy | Same as above |

**Original readiness snapshot, preserved unchanged:** READY FOR AUTHOR DECISION = **16**. REQUIRES MORE RESEARCH = **4**. DEFERRED BEYOND PHASE 1B = **0**. Total = **20**. This historical snapshot is not silently replaced — it remains the accurate description of gate *readiness* as of the Phase 1A commit `a142da371c766bbc3489d7d9ae26e6421527c6c9`.

**Current post-decision status:** AUTHOR-DECISION RESOLVED = **20**. PENDING AUTHOR DECISION = **0**. IMPLEMENTED = **0**. PRODUCTION-APPROVED = **0**.

**Clarification (binding):** Gates 10, 11, 12, and 13 are resolved **at the policy-decision level only**. Provider-specific mechanisms (which provider API, exact completion-evidence source, exact candle-key field set, network retry/backoff behavior, etc.) and all implementation details remain deferred, per Part 14 below. **A resolved decision gate does not mean its software exists.** No gate's `IMPLEMENTED` or `PRODUCTION-APPROVED` count has moved from zero.

## 15. Prohibited Implementation Scope (This Task)

This document does not, and no companion edit made alongside it does:

- Create the repository scaffold or any application directory (`src/`, `app/`, `tests/`, `config/`, `scripts/`, `.github/`, `manifests/`, `data/`, `fixtures/`, `migrations/`)
- Create application code of any kind
- Create any executable schema (Pydantic model, JSON Schema file, database table)
- Install or configure any technology
- Create `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, any CI workflow file, any source directory, any test directory, any manifest file, any configuration file, any fixture, any database, any migration, any container file, or any `.env` file
- Create a provider adapter of any kind
- Stage, commit, or push anything

## 16. Phase 1B Scaffold-Entry Status

**The Phase 1B repository scaffold has not been created and is not authorized by this document.** Author approval of the decisions recorded in this register resolves *what* the scaffold should eventually contain — it does not itself authorize *creating* any file. A separate, explicit, future instruction is required before any scaffold directory, manifest, dependency file, configuration file, contract stub, validation stub, test file, or CI file is created. The next controlled task is: **Phase 1B repository scaffold implementation — define and review the exact directory, configuration, manifest, contract-stub, validation-stub, test and CI file scope before creating any files.**

## 17. Approval Status

This document is a **governance record**, not an engineering recommendation of its own. It records that the author has approved the decisions in Decision Groups 1 through 8, as stated by the author. It does not itself carry an `ENGINEERING-RECOMMENDED`/`ENGINEERING-PROVISIONAL`/`DEFERRED` label, because it proposes nothing new — every value recorded here traces to either a pre-existing Phase 1A engineering recommendation (Part 7/Part 10 of `PHASE_1A_SOFTWARE_FOUNDATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`) now marked `AUTHOR-APPROVED`, or to a decision the author stated directly in this task's instruction (e.g., UUIDv7, SHA-256, MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, the candle data-quality enums, the ingestion-adapter boundary, the manifest formats). **No decision in this document is self-approving; every one is attributed to an explicit author statement.** No technology is installed. No scaffold exists. No file outside this document's own creation and the six companion updates listed in the governing task instruction is affected.
